# Basic webpage template

### Using LESS for stylesheets
This template project is setup to use **grunt** to compile LESS into CSS.
To get started, you must run a few commands from your project directory.
(Note, this assumes you've installed **npm** already)

1. Make sure the grunt command line tools are installed globally
`npm install -g grunt-cli`

2. Install grunt locally, along with other packages defined in **package.json**

`npm install`


And when in doubt, just read the Grunt Getting Started guide: https://gruntjs.com/getting-started
